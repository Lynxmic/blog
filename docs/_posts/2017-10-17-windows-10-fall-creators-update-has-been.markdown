Today (October 17th, 2017), Windows 10 Fall Creators Update has been released, featuring Fluent Design, and some more features. Don't except to be some biggest feature on this update; in the next major update of Windows 10 there will be some big features. On this update there are new emojis like dinosaurs, genies, fairies, and zombies in the time for Halloween, since this update is released in the fall... Also, Microsoft Edge now has a new feature, Now you can pin websites to the taskbar like you could do with IE11 in Windows 8.1. Also there's a small update to IE11 for Windows 10 Fall Creators Update; now the search bar is enabled by default. Yes, I will get it because I personally like the new Fluent Design.

Microsoft will now move to the next Windows 10 major update.
