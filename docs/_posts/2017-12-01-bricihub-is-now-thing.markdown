Welcome to this blog post,

Our new network (BriciHub) has launched today at 3:45 PM EET (GMT+2). It is the very first succesfull network/hub by me (BriciWorld). BSDev, BW-Slipdost, The Techseasons Lounge, Sapphire, and The BS Community are currently a part of BriciHub. For updates related to BriciHub, check out [our Twitter][twitter].
