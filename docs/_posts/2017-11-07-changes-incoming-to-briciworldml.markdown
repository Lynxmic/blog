Hey everyone,

My website, BriciWorld.ml is going to have some changes tomorrow. Here are the list of changes:

## The actual major change to the website

I don't know if you have waited so long for this feature, but finally I have started active development on a thing called "Dark Mode", or "Night Mode", whatever. This allows you to browse BriciWorld.ml when it's night, or if the normal mode hurts your eyes. Here is a sneak peek of the feature. (It's not public for now)
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img class="is-hidden-mobile" width="45%" height="auto" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.image_src }}opera_2017-11-07_18-30-46.png">
<img class="is-hidden-widescreen" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.image_src }}opera_2017-11-07_18-30-46.png">
</div>

## Other small changes list

The website now has updated links.
New page (with 2 other pages in menu). This is a rewrite of the Discord server website. [Check it out here][1].
Nothing very special on the surface!
So that's all for these changes...

## In other news

What happened to my PC?
Well, yesterday my PC/laptop had a white line, and a small part of my screen is cracked somehow. 
It's not a problem if the battery is dead, but this might be somewhat a big problem. 

That means, soon (in 1 month, smh) that I am going to get a new laptop. It should work great at livestreaming, because when I was livestreaming on YouTube "Having fun with Windows 98 with Plus!" my laptop was lagging. and I had to just cancel the stream and not do any livestreams anymore. This is bad, because I didn't had enough RAM (<4GB) and because I had less cores and threads (see the last screenshot below):
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img class="is-hidden-mobile" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.image_src }}Speccy_2017-11-07_19-07-15.png">
<img class="is-hidden-widescreen" src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{{ site.image_src }}Speccy_2017-11-07_19-07-15.png">
</div>
I found that I had only 2 cores and threads from Speccy, in August. when I was about to livestream "Having fun with Windows 98 with Plus!" on YouTube.

Thanks for reading and see you at the next blog post, maybe a tech blog post this time

Sincerely,
BriciWorld
