Hello there. Today at 20:45 PM EET BriciWorld Lounge, a server created in April 2017 and remade in July 2017 will merge with Aqua Community as it is dying since November 2017.

That means BriciWorld Lounge will be archived (aka the chats will be read-only).

Thank you all for being in this server and being active in there. I had a good time chatting in there in the Summer 2017. It was fun, but good things come to an end. See you in Aqua Community. ðŸ‘‹

Feel free to join the new Aqua here: [https://discord.gg/8NP6NNu][aqua]

Sincerely,
-BriciWorld
