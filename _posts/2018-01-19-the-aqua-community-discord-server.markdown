Hello there. It's been a while since I've last made a blog post. This is the first post of 2018. Now to the blog post

So, on December 28th, 2017, a new server has occurred with the name Aqua Community. Right now it has 40 members, this means alot to me. The BS Community also grown and it currently has 55+ members; the server isn't as active as Aqua Community. In the server you can talk about everything, and the server is a great place for everyone.

## What will happen to The BS Community now if Aqua is here?
It will be still there, and there will be still changes to it, but we'll focus more on Aqua Community, as you can see in the BS Community, it is dying, it's dead.

The BS Community just started dying in like November 2017.
