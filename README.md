# Lynxmic Blog

This repository stores the files for the Jekyll-powered Lynxmic Blog, and mainly exists so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages. The only reason this repository is public is because it cannot be set to private; the ability of running GitHub Pages from a private repo is put behind a paywall.
