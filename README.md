# Lynxmic Blog

This repository stores the files for the Jekyll-powered Lynxmic Blog, and mainly exists so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages.

Keep in mind: The code on this repository is not meant to be interacted with by anyone other than Lynxmic. The only reason this repository is public is because it cannot be set to private; the ability of running GitHub Pages from a private repo is put behind a paywall.
