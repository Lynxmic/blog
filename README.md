# Lynxmic Blog

This repository stores the source code for the Jekyll-powered Lynxmic Blog, and mainly exists so it can be hosted on GitHub Pages. The source code is only public because private repositories are still behind a paywall if you want to host a public website on Pages; please do not interact with them in any way, shape, or form!
